# Japanese Flashcards

A simple application created to learn japanese words. Contains built-in access to a dictionary, so you don't need to type word/translation manually. You can just find it and immediately add it to your list. Reviewing system is similar to Leitner system, only has more options when answering (miss, easy, normal and hard instead of know / don't know).
